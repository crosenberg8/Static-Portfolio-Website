				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a portfolio website from absolute scratch, that displays my care for detail, CS/ME skills, and most importantly, <b><em>my ultimate curiosity for all things computer science!</b></em></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How did I do it?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Before coding my website, I designed each page in Adobe Illustrator to figure out the colors, spacing, and overall design before I even touched the code.</li>
					<li>Once I had all of my designs finished, I used HTML and CSS to create a working copy of my website locally on my computer.</li>
					<li>Once I had all the overall layout with HTML/CSS finished, I programmed the functionality of the <a href="contact-me.html">Contact-Me</a> form with JavaScript and JQuery. For the form, I connected the third-party mail service <a href="https://formspree.io/">form spree</a> with my JS/JQ code so that people could contact me easily through my site.</li>
					<li>Finally, once I had the website coded, and functionality added, I decided to host my website with <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">hostgator.com</a> because my school only offered free word-press hosting services.</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Objective</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a full-stack interactive web application, using both frontend and backend technologies.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How did I do it?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>For the front end of the website, I used basic HTML and CSS techniques, but placed them into an EJS file so I could insert code using the backend. For the backend, I used a variety of libraries such as Express, Body Parser, EJS, and more. <b>This is cool because</b> all of the processing is done on the server side of things, rather than on the user's side of things! This was my first time ever dealing with the backend of websites, and servers as well!</li>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Make a fully-functional program from scratch, that tested my UI design, functionality, and logic skills into one simple user program</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How did I do it?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Before actually creating the program, I made a document with the features I wanted the software to have, before designing.</li>
					<li>Once I knew all the features and functionality of the program, I began designing the program with JavaFX, in the JetBrains IntelliJ IDE.</li>
					<li>After I finished coding the program (and adding alerts for edge/incorrect user entry cases), I then added JavaDoc comments to my code, so that the people reading the code could easily see what was going on.</li>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a CAD model (along with its properly dimensioned drawings), of anything that has at least separate parts that are connected via semi-permanent connections of the designer&#39;s choosing. Each part must fit within a 3in x 3in x 3in volume.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How did I do it?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Before even touching Solidworks, I first hand drew what I wanted Chappie to look like on some paper (provided in downloads).</li>
					<li>Once I had an idea of what I wanted Chappie to look like, I then began to model him in Solidworks. While modeling, I made sure to keep in mind proper dimensioning protocol (such as adding extra room in my sockets since 3D printers are not 100% accurate), so that when I printed my parts out, they would all interconnect properly!</li>
					<li>Once I had all my CAD models, I sent them to the SLS 3D Printer that tech has, and got my CAD models printed out!</li>
					<li>Once I received the 3D printed parts, they surprisingly needed no sanding for the sockets to fit (meaning I dimensioned them properly!).</li>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>In a team, design a moving system in Solidworks that would theoretically solve a problem in the real-world. It must have at least 10 parts, a report must be made on how it would be used in the real world, as well as some renders of the system showing how it would be used.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>How did we/I do it?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Once my team and I decided on the Eco-Guardian idea, we all assigned each person their parts/systems.</li>
					<li>I was responsible for designing the rotating fire retardant dispersion system, in which I used pistons to extend the nozzles all around the center of the body.</li>
					<li>Once I designed my system, produced my drawings, and received the systems that my teammates made, I was then responsible for putting everyone&#39;s systems together, and creating the final renders for the project.</li>
					<li>Once I had the renders imported from Solidworks into Photoshop, I blended the renders with real pictures of forest fires and put those into the slides of the presentation.</li>
					<li><b>Fun fact:</b> Due to the fact that I already had Solidworks experience before taking the class, I decided to take on the role of team-leader, and helped all of my teammates complete their systems in the Eco-guardian, as well as coordinated the meetings + created the outline for the powerpoint. I wasn&#39;t expecting this but while doing the final presentation for the project in front of the class, my team actually gave me a surprise round of applause which made me super happy!</li>
